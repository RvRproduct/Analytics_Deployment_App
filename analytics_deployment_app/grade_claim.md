### Roberto Reynoso
#### Grade Claim

* Hours: 133
&nbsp;

* Liked: Teacher, How we were taught (didn't just give me a text book and told me to read), team based assignments, and Student engagement in conversation. 
&nbsp;

* Dislikes: Nothing really.
&nbsp;

* Recommendations: Maybe getting used to Docker earlier in the course.
&nbsp;

* Understanding: I feel as though, I have gained a great understanding of the material in this course. I am very confident in using Pyspark, Sparksql, and
Databricks. I have gained a good understanding on how to use Docker, Streamlit, and Heroku. I was able to improve a lot on my skills as a data scientist,
because of this class.
&nbsp;

* Involvement: I attended Just about every Class apart from when I was out of town. I was very active with my team-members (we became good friends) we were
always able to get our team assignments done and we would actively communicate, which to me is such a blessing to have. I did my best to be actively engaged with the conversations we had in class. If I had a doubt, I would meet with you (teacher, Hathaway), so that it could be resolved, or I would reach out to my team-members/classmates.
&nbsp;

* Impact: Every single team and individual assignment has my fingerprints on it. We all worked together and split up the workload and were able to ask
one another questions and then give responses. I don't feel at all cheated or weak about this subject, I know I put in great effort to get through any
challenge that was in my way.
&nbsp;

* With that being said, I did put in a lot of time and effort in this final coding challenge, projects, and team. I would like to request an **A**. While I
don't know my final grade on this assignment, I am confident the work is proficient.
