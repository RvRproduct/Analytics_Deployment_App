* DataBricks and Contrast Thoughts: Comparing using Pyspark to Pandas, I see the Pros of Using Databricks than just using pandas in say visual studio. Everything is 
set-up so nicelyand it becomes easier and faster to manipulate data, since pyspark and sparksql is really the back bone of looking at data. 
I found it super useful switching from thetwo. I feel pretty confident now, with my ability to go through big data and pretty
confident in using databricks as one of my main resources to work in data science.

* Docker: Is very similar to a virtual environment. You are able to make an image of your data/application(folder), while having certain dependencies that docker will
for said program. Then it can be used as a container, which anyone (with the correct permissions) can use, without having to download dependencies on their own or 
having to download all the files for the program, Docker takes care of that for you.

* Statistical Regression and Machine Learning Regression Difference: Machine learning models are made to make the most accurate predictions as possible, while
statisitical models are made for inference about the relationships between variables.
